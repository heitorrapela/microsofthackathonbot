# suggested actions sample
Bot Framework v4 suggested actions bot sample

This bot has been created using [Microsoft Bot Framework][1], it shows how to use suggested actions.  Suggested actions enable your bot to present buttons that the user can tap to provide input.

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js][4] version 10.14 or higher
    ```bash
    # determine node version
    node --version
    ```

# To try this sample
- Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
    ```
- In a terminal, navigate to `samples/javascript_nodejs/08.suggested-actions`
    ```bash
    cd samples/javascript_nodejs/08.suggested-actions
    ```
- Install modules
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
- Start the bot
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

# Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator **v4**
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator][5] is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator version 4.2.0 or greater from [here][6]

## Connect to the bot using Bot Framework Emulator **v4**
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot Configuration
- Navigate to `samples/javascript_nodejs/08.suggested-actions` folder
- Select `suggested-actions.bot` file

# Suggested Actions
Suggested actions enable your bot to present buttons that the user can tap to provide input. Suggested actions appear close to the composer and enhance user experience.
They enable the user to answer a question or make a selection with a simple tap of a button, rather than having to type a response with a keyboard.

Unlike buttons that appear within rich cards (which remain visible and accessible to the user even after being tapped), buttons that appear within the suggested actions pane will disappear after the user makes a selection. This prevents the user from tapping stale buttons within a conversation and simplifies bot development (since you will not need to account for that scenario).

# Deploy this bot to Azure
## Prerequisites
- [Azure Deployment Prerequisites][41]

## Provision a Bot with Azure Bot Service
After creating the bot and testing it locally, you can deploy it to Azure to make it accessible from anywhere.  To deploy your bot to Azure:

```bash
# login to Azure
az login
```

```bash
# set you Azure subscription
az account set --subscription "<azure-subscription>"
```

```bash
# provision Azure Bot Services resources to host your bot
msbot clone services --name "<your_bot_name>" --code-dir "." --location westus --sdkLanguage "Node" --folder deploymentScripts/msbotClone --verbose
```

### Publishing Changes to Azure Bot Service
As you make changes to your bot running locally, and want to deploy those change to Azure Bot Service, you can _publish_ those change using either `publish.cmd` if you are on Windows or `./publish` if you are on a non-Windows platform.  The following is an example of publishing

```bash
# run the publish helper (non-Windows) to update Azure Bot Service.  Use publish.cmd if running on Windows
./publish
```

### Getting Additional Help Deploying to Azure
To learn more about deploying a bot to Azure, see [Deploy your bot to Azure][40] for a complete list of deployment instructions.
