# prompt validation sample
Bot Framework v4 prompt validation bot sample

This bot has been created using [Microsoft Bot Framework][1], it shows how a conversation between a bot and a user often involves asking (prompting) the user for information.  This sample shows how to use the prompt classes included in `botbuilder-dialogs`.  This bot will ask for multiple pieces of information from the user, each using a different type of prompt, each with its own validation rules. This sample also demonstrates using the `ComponentDialog` class to encapsulate related sub-dialogs.

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js][4] version 10.14 or higher
    ```bash
    # determine node version
    node --version
    ```

# To try this sample
- Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
    ```
- In a terminal, navigate to `samples/javascript_nodejs/10.prompt-validations`
    ```bash
    cd samples/javascript_nodejs/10.prompt-validations
    ```
- Install modules
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
- Start the bot
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

# Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator **v4**
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator][5] is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator version 4.2.0 or greater from [here][6]

## Connect to the bot using Bot Framework Emulator **v4**
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot Configuration
- Navigate to `javascript_nodejs/10.prompt-validations` folder
- Select `prompt-validations.bot` file

# Prompts
A conversation between a bot and a user often involves asking (prompting) the user for information,
parsing the user's response, and then acting on that information. This sample demonstrates how to
prompt users for information and validate the incoming responses using the different prompt types included in the
[botbuilder-dialogs](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/tree/master/libraries/botbuilder-dialogs)
library.

The `botbuilder-dialogs` library includes a variety of pre-built prompt classes, including text, number,
and datetime types. In this sample, each prompt is wrapped in a custom class that includes a validation
function. These prompts are chained together into a `WaterfallDialog`, and the final results are stored
using the state manager.

# Deploy this bot to Azure
## Prerequisites
- [Azure Deployment Prerequisites][41]

## Provision a Bot with Azure Bot Service
After creating the bot and testing it locally, you can deploy it to Azure to make it accessible from anywhere.  To deploy your bot to Azure:

```bash
# login to Azure
az login
```

```bash
# set you Azure subscription
az account set --subscription "<azure-subscription>"
```

```bash
# provision Azure Bot Services resources to host your bot
msbot clone services --name "<your_bot_name>" --code-dir "." --location westus --sdkLanguage "Node" --folder deploymentScripts/msbotClone --verbose
```

### Publishing Changes to Azure Bot Service
As you make changes to your bot running locally, and want to deploy those change to Azure Bot Service, you can _publish_ those change using either `publish.cmd` if you are on Windows or `./publish` if you are on a non-Windows platform.  The following is an example of publishing

```bash
# run the publish helper (non-Windows) to update Azure Bot Service.  Use publish.cmd if running on Windows
./publish
```

### Getting Additional Help Deploying to Azure
To learn more about deploying a bot to Azure, see [Deploy your bot to Azure][40] for a complete list of deployment instructions.
