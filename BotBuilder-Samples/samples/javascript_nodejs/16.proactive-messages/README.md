# proactive messages sample
Bot Framework v4 proactive messages bot sample

This sample demonstrates how to send proactive messages to users by
capturing a conversation reference, then using it later to initialize
outbound messages.

# Concepts introduced in this sample
Typically, each message that a bot sends to the user directly relates to the user's prior input. In some cases,
a bot may need to send the user a message that is not directly related to the current topic of conversation. These
types of messages are called proactive messages.

Proactive messages can be useful in a variety of scenarios. If a bot sets a timer or reminder, it will need to
notify the user when the time arrives. Or, if a bot receives a notification from an external system, it may need
to communicate that information to the user immediately. For example, if the user has previously asked the bot to
monitor the price of a product, the bot can alert the user if the price of the product has dropped by 20%. Or,
if a bot requires some time to compile a response to the user's question, it may inform the user of the delay
and allow the conversation to continue in the meantime. When the bot finishes compiling the response to the
question, it will share that information with the user.

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js][4] version 10.14 or higher
    ```bash
    # determine node version
    node --version
    ```

# To try this sample
- Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
    ```
- In a terminal, navigate to `samples/javascript_nodejs/16.proactive-messages`
    ```bash
    cd samples/javascript_nodejs/16.proactive-messages
    ```
- Install modules
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
- Start the bot
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

# Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator **v4**
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator][5] is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator version 4.2.0 or greater from [here][6]

## Connect to the bot using Bot Framework Emulator **v4**
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot Configuration
- Navigate to `javascript_nodejs/16.proactive-messages` folder
- Select `proactive-messages.bot` file


Run your bot locally and open two instances of the emulator.

1. In the first emulator, type "run" to simulate a job being added to the queue.
1. Copy the job number from the emulator log.
1. In the second emulator, type "done \<jobNumber\>", where "\<jobNumber\>" is the job number, without the angle brackets, that you copied in the previous step. This will cause the bot to complete the job.
1. Note that the bot sends a message proactively to the user in the first emulator when the job is completed.


# Proactive Messages
In addition to responding to incoming messages, bots are frequently called on to send "proactive" messages
based on activity, scheduled tasks, or external events.

In order to send a proactive message using Botbuilder, the bot must first capture a conversation reference
from an incoming message using `TurnContext.getConversationReference()`. This reference can be stored for
later use.

To send proactive messages, acquire a conversation reference, then use `adapter.continueConversation()` to
create a TurnContext object that will allow the bot to deliver the new outgoing message.

# Deploy this bot to Azure
## Prerequisites
- [Azure Deployment Prerequisites][41]

## Provision a Bot with Azure Bot Service
After creating the bot and testing it locally, you can deploy it to Azure to make it accessible from anywhere.  To deploy your bot to Azure:

```bash
# login to Azure
az login
```

```bash
# set you Azure subscription
az account set --subscription "<azure-subscription>"
```

```bash
# provision Azure Bot Services resources to host your bot
msbot clone services --name "<your_bot_name>" --code-dir "." --location westus --sdkLanguage "Node" --folder deploymentScripts/msbotClone --verbose
```

### Publishing Changes to Azure Bot Service
As you make changes to your bot running locally, and want to deploy those change to Azure Bot Service, you can _publish_ those change using either `publish.cmd` if you are on Windows or `./publish` if you are on a non-Windows platform.  The following is an example of publishing

```bash
# run the publish helper (non-Windows) to update Azure Bot Service.  Use publish.cmd if running on Windows
./publish
```

### Getting Additional Help Deploying to Azure
To learn more about deploying a bot to Azure, see [Deploy your bot to Azure][40] for a complete list of deployment instructions.
